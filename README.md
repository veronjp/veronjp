# Hi, I’m Veronica 👋

I’m a self-taught **Data Analyst & Customer Insights professional** with 10+ years of experience in strategy, insurance, and FMCG, now combining **data analytics, psychology, and storytelling** to understand how people actually behave.

I migrated to Australia on my own, rebuilt my career from scratch, and returned to university to study psychology — driven by a deep curiosity about decision-making, behaviour change, and human systems.

- Customer & behavioural insights  
- Translating data into clear business decisions  
- Experimentation, testing, and measurement  
- Applying psychology to analytics and strategy

- **Data:** SQL, Excel, Power BI, Looker Studio

- Insight-driven dashboards
